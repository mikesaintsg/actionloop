## Current Focus: 4.1 Documentation

### Requirements

1. Complete README.md with installation and quick start
2. Finalize guides/actionloop.md API guide
3. Update guides/whitepaper.md with final architecture
4. Add inline TSDoc comments to all public exports
5. Create CHANGELOG.md

### Implementation Checklist

**Documentation (4.1):**
- [ ] Finalize README.md with all sections
- [ ] Complete guides/actionloop.md API guide
- [ ] Update guides/whitepaper.md
- [ ] Add TSDoc to all factory functions
- [ ] Add TSDoc to all interface methods
- [ ] Create CHANGELOG.md
- [ ] Verify all code examples compile

**Showcase Demo (4.2):**
- [ ] Create showcase/index.html
- [ ] Create showcase/main.ts with demo workflow
- [ ] Create showcase/styles.css
- [ ] Demonstrate all core features
- [ ] Add prediction visualization
- [ ] Add session tracking display

**Integration Examples (4.3):**
- [ ] Add navigation integration example
- [ ] Add indexeddb persistence example
- [ ] Add broadcast cross-tab sync example
- [ ] Add form micro-transitions example

**Edge Cases (4.4):**
- [ ] Handle empty graphs gracefully
- [ ] Handle concurrent session access
- [ ] Handle weight overflow prevention
- [ ] Handle malformed import data
- [ ] Add recovery mechanisms for common errors

**Performance (4.5):**
- [ ] Benchmark prediction latency
- [ ] Optimize weight lookups (Map-based)
- [ ] Optimize SCC algorithm for large graphs
- [ ] Add memory usage monitoring
- [ ] Verify <50ms prediction target

**Final Testing (4.6):**
- [ ] Achieve 80%+ test coverage
- [ ] Add integration tests
- [ ] Add performance regression tests
- [ ] Run all quality gates
- [ ] Fix any remaining TypeScript errors

### Acceptance Criteria

```typescript
// Documentation accuracy
// All code examples in guides should compile and run

// Showcase demo
// showcase/main.ts should demonstrate:
// 1. Creating procedural graph with transitions
// 2. Creating predictive graph with decay
// 3. Creating workflow engine
// 4. Recording transitions
// 5. Getting predictions
// 6. Session management
// 7. Weight persistence (localStorage)

// Performance
// predictNext() should complete in <50ms for graphs with:
// - Up to 1000 nodes
// - Up to 10000 transitions
// - Up to 100000 weight entries
```

### Blocked By

- Phase 3 (Workflow Systems) — all systems must be complete

### Blocks

- NPM publish — package ready for release

## Quality Gates (Phase-Specific)

```powershell
npm run check    # Typecheck (no emit)
npm run format   # Lint and autofix
npm run build    # Build library
npm test         # Unit tests
npm run show     # Build showcase
```

**Current Status:**

| Gate | Last Run | Result |
|------|----------|--------|
| `npm run check` | — | ⏳ |
| `npm run format` | — | ⏳ |
| `npm run build` | — | ⏳ |
| `npm test` | — | ⏳ |
| `npm run show` | — | ⏳ |

## Notes

> **Instructions:** Add observations, gotchas, and decisions during implementation.

- Showcase should be a single-page demo that runs in browser
- Use Vite for showcase build with single-file output
- Consider adding visual graph rendering in showcase
- All documentation code examples should be verified to compile
- Remember: Use `#` private fields, not `private` keyword

## Rollback Notes

> **Purpose:** If something goes wrong, how to recover.

**Safe State:** End of Phase 3
**Files to Revert:** showcase/*, guides/*, CHANGELOG.md
**Dependencies:** None
